<h1>Safe and Secure Traffic Watcher (SSTW)</h1>
SSTW is a software that integrates AI with software construct and a future outlook for IoT implementations to watch over the increasingly dense traffic which is projected to be quite overwhelming in the future.

<h2>Model</h2>
Currently, SSTW employs YOLOv8n as our main detector with DeepSORT as the tracker. We experimented with a two-stage classical detector resembling the original R-CNN architecture although the result was not satisfactory with low FPS and detector performance.
